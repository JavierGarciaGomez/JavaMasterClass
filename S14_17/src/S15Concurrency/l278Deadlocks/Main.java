    -SUMMARY
        -Deadlock

    -NOTES
        -Deadlock occurs when 2 or more threads are blocked on locks and every thread that's blocked is holding a lock
            that another block thread wants for example thread1 is holding lock2 and waiting to acquire lcok1 because
            all the  threads holding the locks are blocked they will never release the locks and none of the threads will run.
